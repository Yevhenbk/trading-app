# Trading App

The app is represented in two columns, the first one of which calculates the average between the response of three APIs that are set inside 
the project in JSON files (due to many errors occuring while fetching irl) while clicking the button.\
Other part is represented in columns that serve the user as a "remote controller". User can click on any of these buttons and will see the following 
data being fetched in real time and represented down below.
